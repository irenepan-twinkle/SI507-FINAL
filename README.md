# SI507-FINAL
final project for SI507

This is a World News Search Engine which enables us to search the news from different countries.

The Jupyter notebook called anotherpartAPI is used to fetch data from three different news APIs.

I stored 10,023 news data into database called news.db

To run the news search engine, you should run the front_end.py file and you can search news in the search page.
